5. Selenium architecture 3?
=> 	1. Selenium Client library: Selenium provides support to multiple libraries such as Ruby, Python, Java, etc as language bindings
	2. JSON wire protocol over HTTP: JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation. It is an open standard that provides a transport mechanism for transferring data between client and server on the web.
	3. Browser Drivers: Selenium browser drivers are native to each browser, interacting with the browser by establishing a secure connection. Selenium supports different browser drivers such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, Microsoft Edge WebDriver, SafariDriver, and InternetExplorerDriver.
	4. Browsers: Selenium provides support for multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer etc.

6.  Selenium architecture 4?
=>  The architecture of Selenium 4 is similar to Selenium 3, however it uses W3C protocol instead of JSON wire protocol for communication between Client Libraries and Browser Drivers.
